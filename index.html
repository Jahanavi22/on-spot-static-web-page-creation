        <h2>About Ram Mandir</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.</li>
            <li>The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE. The disputed site was at the center of a long-standing legal and socio-political dispute between Hindus and Muslims.</li>
            <li>The murtis of Rama and Sita were installed inside the Babri Masjid on the night of 22â€“23 December 1949 and the devotees began to gather from the next day. By 1950, the state took control of the mosque under section 145 CrPC and allowed Hindus, not Muslims, to perform their worship at the site.</li>
            <li>The demolition of the mosque resulted in several months of inter-communal violence between India's Hindu and Muslim communities, causing the death of an estimated 2,000 people in Bombay (now Mumbai) as a direct consequence, and triggering riots all over the Indian subcontinent.</li>
            <li>In Supreme Court's verdict on the Ayodhya dispute in 2019, it was decided that the disputed land would be handed over to a trust formed by the Government of India for the construction of a Ram temple. The trust was eventually formed under the name of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.</li>
            <li>On 5 February 2020, it was announced in the Parliament of India that the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had accepted a plan to construct the temple. Two days later, on 7 February, five acres of land were allocated for a new mosque to be built 22 km (14 mi) away from Ayodhya in Dhannipur village.</li>
            <li>Ram Lalla Virajman, the infant form of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the temple. Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.</li>
            <li>According to the temple trust, the final blueprint includes temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds. Two idols of Ram Lalla (one of them being 5 years old) will be placed in the sanctum of the temple.</li>
            <li>On 29 December 2023, the selection of the idol of Ram Lalla for the Ayodhya Ram temple was done through a voting process. Karnataka-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj created the idol of Rama.</li>
            <li>It has been officially announced that 22 January 2024 is the scheduled date for the installation of the Lord Ram idol in the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) by Champat Rai, the General Secretary of the Sri Ram Janmbhoomi Kshetra Trust. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on 25 October 2023, was extended a formal invitation to attend the ceremony.</li>
